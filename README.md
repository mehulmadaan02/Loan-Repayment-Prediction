# LoanRepaymentPrediction
The aim of this project was to explore, analyze and build a machine learning algorithm for the purpose of correctly identifying whether a person, given certain characteristics, has a high likelihood to default on a loan. This type of model could be used by LendingClub to identify certain financial traits of future borrowers that could have the potential to default and not pay back their loan.
