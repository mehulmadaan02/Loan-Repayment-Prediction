# LoanRepaymentPrediction
The aim of this project was to explore, analyze and build a machine learning algorithm for the purpose of correctly identifying whether a person, given certain characteristics, has a high likelihood to default on a loan. This type of model could be used by LendingClub to identify certain financial traits of future borrowers that could have the potential to default and not pay back their loan.

Since the Dataset is very large, it cannot be directly uploaded to github but you can download the required files from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data?select=loan.csv

The project contains the following file:
